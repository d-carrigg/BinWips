# Path to v1.0

This document describes the path to the v1.0 release of the project.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the whole file/parameter selection idea (instead of just using first/last item provide parameters to override)
- [ ] Add Tests for things like command injection to ensure security
- [ ] Add info in docs on security (point out how powershell session are made, things like signing)
- [x] Add Table of Contents to README section for parameters
- [ ] Improve how Bflat is downloaded and managed (not a huge fan of the silent download)
