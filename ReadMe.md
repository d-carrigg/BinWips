# BinWips

:construction: Warning: This repository is still under construction, see the [TODO List](#TODO-List) at the bottom to make sure the features you want are completeâ€‹

Binary Written in PowerShell. Convert `.ps1` files to executables with sensible defaults. You can use the built in parameters to customize output, including control over the generated `.cs`, `.exe` files and any additional resources.  You can also generate .NET libraries (`.dll`s) which can be consumed by other .NET applications. Compilation targets include any valid platform for `.NET` application including `x86`,`x64` and MSIL (`Any CPU`). 

## Getting Started

Install the module with:

```powershell
# TODO: Publish so this works: Install-Module BinWips
# For now, git clone the repo
Install-Module /gitrepo/src/Modules/BinWips
```

Create a simple program from an inline script block:

```powershell
New-PSBinary -ScriptBlock {echo "Hello World!"}
```

This will generate a program named `PSBinary.exe` in the current directory. Confirm everything worked by running:

```powershell
.\PSBinary.exe
```

You should see the following output:

```text
Hello World!
```

You can also generate programs from script files:

```powershell
New-PSBinary -InFile "path/to/myScript.ps1"
```

An executable will be generated in the current directory with the name `myScript.exe`. If you want to produce a library (`dll`) instead you can do so by using the `-Library` parameter:

```PowerShell
New-PSBinary -InFile "path/to/myScript.ps1" -Library
```

## Parameters

BinWips assemblies (both `exe`s and `dll`s) can accept arguments from the caller.

```powershell
# Note the escaped variable `$myParam
New-PSBinary -ScriptBlock {param($myParam); echo "Param was `$myParam"}
# or 
# assume MyScript.ps1 contains param($myParam)
New-PSBinary -InFile "MyScript.ps1"
```

  If you generate a `.exe` the arguments work the same as they would if you wrote a script. E.g.

```bash
.\PSBinary.exe -String1 "Some Text" -ScriptBlock "{Write-Host 'Inception'}" -Switch1 -Array "Arrays?","Of Course"
```

Libraries look a little different than you might expect coming from C#, but they just take a `param string[] args` parameter similar to the Main method of a c# program. The `param` modifier is supplied in case no parameters are passed. Calling in C# would look like

```c#
// both of these work, note the escaping of special chars (",') where neccessary
object result = PSBinary.Invoke("-String 1 'Some Text'", "-ScriptBlock \"{Write-Host 'Inception'}\"", "-Switch1 -Array \"Arrays?\",\"Of Course\"");
object result = PSBinary.Invoke("-String1 \"Some Text\" -ScriptBlock \"{Write-Host 'Inception'}\" -Switch1 -Array \"Arrays?\",\"Of Course\")";
```

DESCRIPTION
    Generates a .EXE from a script.


PARAMETERS
    -ScriptBlock <Object>
        The powershell command to convert into a program
        cannot be combined with `InFile`

    -InFile <String[]>
        Source Script file(s), order is important
        Files added in order entered
        Exe name is defaulted to last file in array

    -Namespace <String>
        Namespace for the generated program.
        This parameter is trumped by -Tokens, so placing a value here will be overriden by
        whatever is in -Tokens
        So if you did -Namespace A -Tokens @{Namespace='B'} Namespace would be set to B not A
        Must be a valid C# namespace
        Defaults to PSBinary

    -ClassName <Object>
        Class name for the generated program
        This parameter is trumped by -Tokens, so placing a value here will be overriden
        by whatever is in -Tokens
        So if you did -ClassName A -Tokens @{ClassName='B'} ClassName would be set to B not A
        must be a valid c# class name and cannot be equal to -Namespace
        Defaults to Program

    -OutFile <String>
        Name of the .exe to generate. Defaults to the -InFile (replaced with .exe) or
        PSBinary.exe if a script block is inlined

    -AssemblyAttributes <String[]>
        Hashtable of assembly attributes to apply to the assembly level.
                    - list of defaults here:
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/global
                    - custom attributes can also be aplied.
                    - Invalid attributes will throw a c# compiler exception
                    - Attributes are applied in addition to the defaults unless -NoDefaultAttributes

    -NoDefaultAttributes [<SwitchParameter>]
        Exclude default attributes from being applied to PSBinary.
        Unless this is included some default attributes will be applied to the program.
        So that other scripts/programs can identify it as a BinWips.

    -ClassAttributes <Hashtable>
        Hashtable of assembly attributes to apply to the class.
                    - Any valid c# class attribute can be applied
                    - Invalid attributes will throw a c# compiler exception
                    - Attributes are applied in addition to the defaults unless -NoDefaultAttributes

    -ClassTemplate <String>
        Override the default class template.
        - BinWips Tokens (a character sequence such as beginning with {# and ending with #}) can be included
          and will be replaced with the matching token either from defaults or the -Tokens paramter.
        - If a BinWips exists with out a matching value in -Tokens an exception is thrown.
        - Example: In the default template there is namespace '{#PSNameSpace#} {...}' when compiled
          {#PSNamespace#} is replaced with PSBinary to produce namesapce PSBinary {...}

    -AttributesTemplate <String>
        Override the default attributes template.
        BinWips Tokens not supported.

    -Tokens <Hashtable>
        Hashtable of tokens to replace in the class template.
        Exclude the '{#' and '#}' in the keys.

        Example:
        -Tokens @{Namespace='CustomNamespace';ClassName='MyCoolClass'}

        Reserved Tokens
        ---------------
        {#Script#} The script content to compile

    -CscArgumentList <String[]>
        Additional C# Compiler parameters you want to pass (e.g. references)

    -OutDir <String>
        Directory to place output in, defaults to current directory
        Dir will be created if it doesn't already exist.

    -ScratchDir <String>
        Change the directory where work will be done defaults to 'obj' folder in current directory
        Use -Clean to clean this directory before building
        Dir will be created if it doesn't already exist.

    -Clean [<SwitchParameter>]
        Clean the scratch directory before building
        As compared to -KeepScratchDir which removes scratch dir *after* build.

    -KeepScratchDir [<SwitchParameter>]
        After build don't remove the scratch dir.
        As compared to -Clean which removes all files in scratch dir *before* build.

    -Force [<SwitchParameter>]
        Overrite -OutFile if it already exists

    -Resources <String[]>
        List of files to include with the app
                    - If -NoEmbedResources is specified then files are embedded in the exe.
                       - Files are copied to out dir with exe if they don't already exist
                    - Else files must be referenced specially (see below)

                  To call files in script (if -NoEmbedresources is *not* included):
                  `$myFile = Get-PsBinaryResource FileName.ext`
                  where `FileName.ext` is the file you want to use.
                  This returns the content of the file, not a path to it.

                  Only use this if you want to package things like settings files
                  or images. Otherwise files are accessed normally by the generated exe.

    -NoEmbedResources [<SwitchParameter>]
        Don't embed any resource specifed by -Resources
        instead they are copied to out dir if they don't already exist

    -Library [<SwitchParameter>]
        Output to a .NET .dll instead of an .exe

    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## Embedding Resources

If you want to package additional files with your application you can uses the `-Resources` parameter. A resource can be any file (images, other `exe`s, `dll`s, etc) and are embedded in the generated .exe by default. In other words, the module will still generate a single file regardless of the number of resources you include.

To include additional files, pass an array of file paths to the `-Resources` parameter. For example, if you want to include 3 files:

1. MyImage.png - located in the same directory as the script
2. MyText.txt - located at c:\foo\MyText.txt
3. MyRequiredLibrary.dll - located at c:\Windows\ImportantFolder\MyRequiredLibrary.dll

you would use the following syntax:

```powershell
New-PSBinary -File MyScript.ps1 -Resources @(
    '.\MyImage.png',
    'c:\foo\MyText.txt',
    'c:\Windows\ImportantFolder\MyRequiredLibrary.dll'
)
```

The files must both exist and you must have access to said files otherwise BinWips will throw a terminating error. All files will be read in and embedded to the `.exe`. To use the resources in your script use the following syntax:

```powershell
$myImageContent = Get-PSBinaryResource ".\MyImage.png"
$myTextContent = Get-PSBinaryResource "c:\foo\MyText.txt"
$myDll = Get-PSBinaryResource "c:\Windows\ImportantFolder\MyRequiredLibrary.dll"
```

A few important notes:

- When you get a binary resource your are getting itâ€™s content, not a path to a file, and not a `File` object. You can use the `-AsFile` parameter if you need a file reference, in which case the embedded resource will be written to a temp file (this is slower as content needs to first be written to disk).
- You canâ€™t use `Get-Content` or `Get-Item` cmdlets with these  files because they do not exist as files when deployed

If you want to deploy the resources next to the `exe` instead of embedding them, include the `-NoEmbedResources` option. In which case the files will be copied to the `-OutDir` if they do not already exist at that location. If all resources are in the same directory as the script, or they already exist on the machine you want to deploy to. You donâ€™t need to include them as resources, you can just access them as you normally would in your PowerShell script.

## Check if an application is a BinWips executable

Built in functionality is provided for checking if an assembly (`exe` or `dll`) was built with BinWips via the `Test-PSBinary` command:

```powershell
Test-PSBinary PSBinary.exe
```

 If you donâ€™t have the BinWips module installed on a machine you can use the following:

```powershell
$Path = 'Path to assembly in question'
# We gotta do some trickery to safely load this file
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3832351/disposing-assembly
# https://www.powershellmagazine.com/2014/03/17/pstip-reading-file-content-as-a-byte-array/
$Path = Resolve-Path $Path
$bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($Path)
$asm = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($bytes)
$attrItems = $asm.GetCustomAttributes($false)
foreach($attr in $attrItems) {
  if($attr.TypeId.Name -eq 'BinWipsAttribute'){
     Write-Host "Assembly is a BinWips executeable"
	}
}
```

## Advanced Usage

You can fully customize the generated output by replacing the class template and you can run additional preprocessing before the compiler is invoked. If the built in customization options don't meet your needs this section will guide you through full customization of the compiled output. This section requires knowledge of C#. Additionally, unless you include the default BinWips attribute in your attributes/class template you will not be able to detect your application as a BinWips application (how-to is included in this section).

## Limitations

There are some things that cannot be accomplished by the BinWips module.

1. Anything from the TODO List that is unchecked wonâ€™t work.
2. Second, you should be aware of any security risks for the .NET Framework version you target
3. BinWips encodes scripts as Base64 strings (and the default class template decodes those strings into plain text before adding them to the runspace) and I believe this helps prevent against sanitization issues, but I havenâ€™t fully tested this. I think this is primarily only a concern if you have a script which creates an `.exe` based on user generated content but I felt it worth sharing.
4. I do not yet recommend using BinWips for production and/or critical environments because of the reasons listed above.
